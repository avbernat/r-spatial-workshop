# what is the average distances?

# can throw these into dnearneigh! 

# Go ahead and see if you can experiment to max and min

#num_neigh <- card(dis_max_nb) # need to turn into a data frame to use ggplot
# ggplot(num_neigh)

# Next: neighbors will be put in a spatial weights matrix, e.g. house salesprice, each of those 6 neighbors will be given a 6th of that weight?
